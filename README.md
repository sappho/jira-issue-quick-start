# Issue Quick Start Plugin

This plugin does one simple job within Atlassian's JIRA. When you create a new issue it will immediately go to the issue's full-page view so that you can immediately begin to work with it. It does this by detecting the "post it" note that pops up when you create an issue, and it switches you to the issue link in the pop-up. It does not do this redirection if you are in an agile panel because it's more likely you'll want the standard agile behaviour.

Download the plugin from the Atlassian Marketplace: https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/uk.org.sappho.jira.plugin.jira-plugin-goto-new-issue/server/overview.
